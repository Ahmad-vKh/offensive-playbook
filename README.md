### What I Do

- Execute high-impact, real-world offensive security operations — from initial access to full domain compromise  
- Engineer **repeatable attack chains** through deep analysis of misconfigs, trust abuse, and multi-layer vulnerabilities  
- Keep a sharp, structured knowledge base in Obsidian — every technique logged, every pattern tracked, nothing forgotten

- Reinforcing every step with structured documentation to turn learning into operational firepower
