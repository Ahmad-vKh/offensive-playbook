# Shells Jack Us In, Payloads Deliver Us Shells
what is shell?
	is a program that provides computer user with an interface to input instruction into the system and view text output (Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell, 
	a shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host

shell gives us direct access to the `OS`, `system commands`, and `file system`.

we can start enumerating the system for vectors that may allow us to escalate privileges, pivot, transfer files, and more. If we don't establish a shell session, we are pretty limited on how far we can get on a target machine.

`harder to detect than graphical shells`, `faster to navigate the OS`, and `easier to automate our actions`

|**Perspective**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Computing`|The text-based userland environment that is utilized to administer tasks and submit instructions on a PC. Think Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell.|
|`Exploitation` `&` `Security`|A shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. An example would be triggering [EternalBlue](https://www.cisecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Security-Primer-EternalBlue.pdf) on a Windows host to gain access to the cmd-prompt on a host remotely.|
|`Web`|This is a bit different. A web shell is much like a standard shell, except it exploits a vulnerability (often the ability to upload a file or script) that provides the attacker with a way to issue instructions, read and access files, and potentially perform destructive actions to the underlying host. Control of the web shell is often done by calling the script within a browser window.|

## Payloads Deliver us Shells

A payload is `code` crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. The term payload can describe various types of malware
