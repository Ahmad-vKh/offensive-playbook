`70%` of websites (webservers) run on a Unix-based system

## Spawning a TTY Shell with Python

```shell-session
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")' 

python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
-upgrade ttyshell
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
ctrl + z
stty raw -echo ;fg

```

## /bin/sh -i
```shell-session
/bin/sh -i
```

## Perl
```shell-session
perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
```

```shell-session
perl: exec "/bin/sh";
```

## Ruby
```shell-session
ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
```

## Lua
```shell-session
lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```

## AWK
```shell-session
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```


## Find
```shell-session
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```

## Using Exec To Launch A Shell
```shell-session
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
```

# Execution Permissions Considerations

In addition to knowing about all the options listed above, we should be mindful of the permissions we have with the shell session's account. We can always attempt to run this command to list the file properties and permissions our account has over any given file or binary:

#### Permissions
```shell-session
ls -la <path/to/fileorbinary>
```

#### Sudo -l
The sudo -l command above will need a stable interactive shell to run. If you are not in a full shell or sitting in an unstable shell, you may not get any return from it. Not only will considering permissions allow us to see what commands we can execute, but it may also start to give us an idea of potential vectors that will allow us to escalate privileges.
