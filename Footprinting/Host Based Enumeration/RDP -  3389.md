commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks.

1- For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside

2- if (`NAT`) is used on the route between client and server, the remote computer needs the `public IP address` to reach the server. In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server.


## Footprinting the Service

```shell
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --script rdp*
```

`Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be identified by `threat hunters` and various security services such as [Endpoint Detection and Response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endpoint_detection_and_response) (`EDR`), and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened networks.`

```shell
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p3389 --packet-trace --disable-arp-ping -n
```



we can connect to RDP servers on Linux using `xfreerdp`, `rdesktop`, or `Remmina` and interact with the GUI of the server accordingly.

```shell
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ ./rdp-sec-check.pl 10.129.201.248
```

#### Initiate an RDP Session

```shell
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /u:cry0l1t3 /p:"P455w0rd!" /v:10.129.201.248
```
