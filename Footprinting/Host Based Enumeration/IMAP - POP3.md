`143`     `993`

ports `110` and `995` are used for POP3, and ports `143` and `993` are used for IMAP. The higher ports (`993` and `995`) use TLS/SSL to encrypt the communication between the client and server.

`Internet Message Access Protocol` (`IMAP`)
`Post Office Protocol`

`IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server and supports folder structures.`

Most companies use third-party email providers such as Google, Microsoft, and many others. However, some companies still use their own mail servers for many different reasons. One of these reasons is to maintain the privacy that they want to keep in their own hands. Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators, which in the worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and received, which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of these configuration options include:

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`auth_debug`|Enables all authentication debug logging.|
|`auth_debug_passwords`|This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.|
|`auth_verbose`|Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.|
|`auth_verbose_passwords`|Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.|
|`auth_anonymous_username`|This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.|
