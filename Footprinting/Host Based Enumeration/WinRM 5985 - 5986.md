WinRM relies on `TCP`

Another component that fits WinRM for administration is Windows Remote Shell (`WinRS`), which lets us execute arbitrary commands on the remote system.

`5985(HTTP) - 5986(HTTPs)`


often we will see that only HTTP (`TCP 5985`) is used instead of HTTPS (`TCP 5986`).

```shell
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -sC 10.129.201.248 -p5985,5986 --disable-arp-ping -n
```

####  evil-winrm
```
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ evil-winrm -i 10.129.201.248 -u Cry0l1t3 -p P455w0rD!
```


## WMI -135

Windows Management Instrumentation (`WMI`)
WMI allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems.

Understandably, this makes it the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers.

WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console (`WMIC`). WMI is not a single program but consists of several programs and various databases, also known as repositories.

WMI communication always takes place on `TCP` port `135`

after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port 
#### WMIexec.py

```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ /usr/share/doc/python3-impacket/examples/wmiexec.py Cry0l1t3:"P455w0rD!"@10.129.201.248 "hostname"
```
