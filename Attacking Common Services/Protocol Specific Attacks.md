# The Concept of Attacks

For any task to come into existence at all, it needs an idea, information (`Source`), a planned process for it (`Processes`), and a specific goal (`Destination`) to be achieved. Therefore, the category of `Privileges` is necessary to control information processing appropriately.



Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to:

- Usernames.
- Email Addresses.
- Passwords.
- DNS records.
- IP Addresses.
- Source code.
- Configuration files.
- PII.

Every target is unique, and we need to familiarize ourselves with our target, its processes, procedures, business model, and purpose. Once we understand our target, we can think about what information is essential for them and what kind of information is helpful for our attack.


1. We need to understand the service and how it works.
2. We need to know what we are looking for.
