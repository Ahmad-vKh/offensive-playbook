>our input was displayed on the page. If no sanitization or filtering was applied to our input, the page might be vulnerable to XSS.


## XSS Testing Payloads
```html
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```

`View Page Source`, and we should see our payload in the page source:
```html
<div></div><ul class="list-unstyled" id="todo"><ul><script>alert(window.origin)</script>
</ul></ul>
```

>**Tip:** Many modern web applications utilize cross-domain IFrames to handle user input, so that even if the web form is vulnerable to XSS, it would not be a vulnerability on the main web application. This is why we are showing the value of `window.origin` in the alert box, instead of a static value like `1`. In this case, the alert box would reveal the URL it is being executed on, and will confirm which form is the vulnerable one, in case an IFrame was being used.

**IFrame** (an embedded webpage within another webpage).
using ``alert(window.origin);``will displays the **domain (origin) where the script is executing**

---
As some modern browsers may block the `alert()` JavaScript function in specific locations, it may be handy to know a few other basic XSS payloads to verify the existence of XSS.

>`<script>print()</script>` that will pop up the browser print dialog, which is unlikely to be blocked by any browsers

---
To see whether the payload is persistent and stored on the back-end, we can refresh the page and see whether we get the alert again. If we do, we would see that we keep getting the alert even throughout page refreshes, confirming that this is indeed a `Stored/Persistent XSS` vulnerability.

`alert(document.cookie)`
`<script>document.cookie</script>`

<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
