flaw in user input sanitization to "write" JavaScript code to the page and execute it on the client side, leading to several types of attacks

>1- A typical web application works by receiving the HTML code from the back-end server and rendering it on the client-side internet browser
>2- a vulnerable web application does not properly sanitize user input,leads to ....
>3- a malicious user can inject extra JavaScript code in an input field `(e.g., comment/reply)` <> here we go
>4- once another user views the same page, they unknowingly execute the malicious JavaScript code.

>>>>>>XSS vulnerabilities are solely executed on the client-side and hence do not directly affect the back-end server.

so this equates to a medium risk (`low impact + high probability = medium risk`), which we should always attempt to `reduce` risk by detecting, remediating, and proactively preventing these types of vulnerabilities.


## XSS Attacks
As XSS attacks execute JavaScript code within the browser, they are limited to the browser's JS engine (i.e., V8 in Chrome). They cannot execute system-wide JavaScript code to do something like system-level code execution. In modern browsers, they are also limited to the same domain of the vulnerable website.



## Types of XSS
three main types of XSS vulnerabilities:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`Stored (Persistent) XSS`|The most critical type of XSS, which occurs when user input is stored on the back-end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments)|
|`Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS`|Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after being processed by the backend server, but without being stored (e.g., search result or error message)|
|`DOM-based XSS`|Another Non-Persistent XSS type that occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is completely processed on the client-side, without reaching the back-end server (e.g., through client-side HTTP parameters or anchor tags)|
