## Automated Discovery
While paid tools usually have a higher level of accuracy in detecting XSS vulnerabilities (especially when security bypasses are required)

so we must always manually verify the XSS injection.

XSS discovery are [XSS Strike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike), [Brute XSS](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/BruteXSS), and [XSSer](https://github.com/epsylon/xsser). We can try `XSS Strike` by cloning it to our VM with `git clone`:

```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike.git
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ cd XSStrike
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ pip install -r requirements.txt
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ python xsstrike.py
```

```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ python xsstrike.py -u "http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php?task=test" 
```
## Manual Discovery
XSS vulnerabilities is manually testing various XSS payloads against an input field in a given web page. We can find huge lists of XSS payloads online, like the one on [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/XSS%20Injection/README.md) or the one in [PayloadBox](https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list)

>Note: XSS can be injected into any input in the HTML page, which is not exclusive to HTML input fields, but may also be in HTTP headers like the Cookie or User-Agent (i.e., when their values are displayed on the page).

---
This is why it may be more efficient to write our own Python script to automate sending these payloads and then comparing the page source to see how our payloads were rendered. This can help us in advanced cases where XSS tools cannot easily send and compare payloads. This way, we would have the advantage of customizing our tool to our target web application.

## Code Review
The most reliable method of detecting XSS vulnerabilities is manual code review,
which should cover both back-end and front-end code

if we understand precisely how our input is being handled all the way until it reaches the web browser, we can write a custom payload that should work with high confidence.

```bash
──(pwn㉿kali)-[~/XSStrike]
└─$ pip install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt

```
