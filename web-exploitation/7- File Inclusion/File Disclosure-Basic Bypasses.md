web application is properly secured against malicious LFI user input, we may be able to bypass the protections in place and reach file inclusion.

## Non-Recursive Path Traversal Filters
it simply deletes substrings of (`../`) to avoid path traversals.
```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```


it is not `recursively removing` the `../` substring, as it runs a single time on the input string and does not apply the filter on the output string
>if we use `....//` as our payload, then the filter would remove `../` and the output string would be `../`

```
http://<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=....//....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

>`..././` or `....\/` and several other recursive LFI payloads. Furthermore, in some cases, escaping the forward slash character may also work to avoid path traversal filters (e.g. `....\/`), or adding extra forward slashes (e.g. `....////`)

## Encoding

Some web filters may prevent input filters that include certain LFI-related characters, like a dot `.` or a slash `/` used for path traversals. However, some of these filters may be bypassed by URL encoding our input

>but would still be decoded back to our path traversal string once it reaches the vulnerable function. Core PHP filters on versions 5.3.4 and earlier were specifically vulnerable to this bypass, but even on newer versions we may find custom filters that may be bypassed through URL encoding.

```
URL encode `../` into `%2e%2e%2f`
```

**Note:** For this to work we must URL encode all characters, including the dots. Some URL encoders may not encode dots as they are considered to be part of the URL scheme.

```
<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%65%74%63%2f%70%61%73%73%77%64
```

>use Burp Decoder to encode the encoded string once again to have a `double encoded` string, which may also bypass other types of filters.

You may refer to the [Command Injections](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/109) module for more about bypassing various blacklisted characters, as the same techniques may be used with LFI as well.


## Approved Paths
Some web applications may also use Regular Expressions to ensure that the file being included is under a specific path. For example, the web application we have been dealing with may only accept paths that are under the `./languages`
```php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```

To find the approved path:
1- `examine the requests sent by the existing forms, and see what path they use for the normal web functionality`

2-`fuzz web directories under the same path, and try different ones until we get a match. To bypass this, we may use path traversal and start our payload with the approved path, and then use `../` to go back to the root directory and read the file we specify`

```bash
<SERVER_IP>:<PORT>/index.php?language=./languages/../../../../etc/passwd
```


>web applications may apply this filter along with one of the earlier filters, so we may combine both techniques by starting our payload with the approved path, and then URL encode our payload or use recursive payload.

## Appended Extension
With modern versions of PHP, we may not be able to bypass this and will be restricted to only reading files in that extension, which may still be useful, as we will see in the next section (e.g. for reading source code).

other techniques we may use, but they are `obsolete with modern versions of PHP and only work with PHP versions before 5.3/5.4`. However, it may still be beneficial to mention them, as some web applications may still be running on older servers, and these techniques may be the only bypasses possible

#### Path Truncation
In earlier versions of PHP, defined strings have a maximum length of 4096 characters, likely due to the limitation of 32-bit systems.

If a longer string is passed, it will simply be `truncated`, and any characters after the maximum length will be ignored.

and PHP would call (`/etc/passwd`). PHP, and Linux systems in general, also disregard multiple slashes in the path (e.g. `////etc/passwd` is the same as `/etc/passwd`). Similarly, a current directory shortcut (`.`) in the middle of the path would also be disregarded (e.g. `/etc/./passwd`)

combine both of these PHP limitations together, we can create very long strings that evaluate to a correct path. Whenever we reach the 4096 character limitation, the appended extension (`.php`) would be truncated, and we would have a path without an appended extension

it is also important to note that we would also need to `start the path with a non-existing directory` for this technique to work.

```url
?language=non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././.[./ REPEATED ~2048 times]
```

Of course, we don't have to manually type `./` 2048 times (total of 4096 characters), but we can automate the creation of this string with the following command:
```shell-session
echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done
non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/./././<SNIP>././././
```


We may also increase the count of `../`, as adding more would still land us in the root directory, as explained in the previous section

if we use this method, we should calculate the full length of the string to ensure only `.php` gets truncated and not our requested file at the end of the string (`/etc/passwd`). This is why it would be easier to use the first method.

#### Null Bytes
PHP versions before 5.5
were vulnerable to `null byte injection`
adding a null byte (`%00`) at the end of the string would terminate the string and not consider anything after it

>This is due to how strings are stored in low-level memory, where strings in memory must use a null byte to indicate the end of the string, as seen in Assembly, C, or C++ languages.

(e.g. `/etc/passwd%00`)
`include()` would be (`/etc/passwd%00.php`).
anything after the null byte would be truncated,
