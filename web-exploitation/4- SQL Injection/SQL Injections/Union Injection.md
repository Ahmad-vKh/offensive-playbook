## 1- Detect number of columns
we need to find the number of columns selected by the server. There are two methods of detecting the number of columns:

- Using `ORDER BY`
- Using `UNION`

#### Using ORDER BY
we can start with `order by 1`, sort by the first column, and succeed, as the table must have at least one column. Then we will do `order by 2` and then `order by 3` until we reach a number that returns an error, or the page does not show any output, which means that this column number does not exist

If we failed at `order by 4`, this means the table has three columns
```sql
' order by 1-- -
```
Reminder: We are adding an extra dash (-) at the end, to show you that there is a space after (--).


#### Using UNION
The other method is to attempt a Union injection with a different number of columns until we successfully get the results back.
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -
```



## 2- Location of Injection
It is very common that not every column will be displayed back to the user. For example, the ID field is often used to link different tables together, but the user doesn't need to see it. This tells us that columns 2 and 3, and 4 are printed to place our injection in any of them. `We cannot place our injection at the beginning, or its output will not be printed.`

`@@version` SQL query as a test and place it in the second column instead of the number 2:
```sql
cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -
```

user()

cn' UNION select 1,user(),3,4-- -
