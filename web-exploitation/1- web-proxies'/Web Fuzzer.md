# Burp Intruder
built-in web fuzzers are powerful tools that act as web fuzzing, enumeration, and brute-forcing tools. This may also act as an alternative for many of the CLI-based fuzzers we use, like `ffuf`, `dirbuster`, `gobuster`, `wfuzz`, among others.

>called `Burp Intruder`

fuzz pages, directories, sub-domains, parameters, parameters values, and many other things

## Target

## Positions

Note: Be sure to leave the extra two lines at the end of the request, otherwise we may get an error response from the server.

## Payloads
![Payload Sets](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/burp_intruder_payload_set.jpg)
'`Sniper`'

- `Simple List`: The basic and most fundamental type. We provide a wordlist, and Intruder iterates over each line in it.
    
- `Runtime file`: Similar to `Simple List`, but loads line-by-line as the scan runs to avoid excessive memory usage by Burp.
    
- `Character Substitution`: Lets us specify a list of characters and their replacements, and Burp Intruder tries all potential permutations.

>can build custom wordlists for each attack

#### Payload Options
We will select `/opt/useful/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt` as our wordlist. We can see that Burp Intruder loads all lines of our wordlist into the Payload Options table:

Tip: In case you wanted to use a very large wordlist, it's best to use `Runtime file` as the Payload Type instead of `Simple List`, so that Burp Intruder won't have to load the entire wordlist in advance, which may throttle memory usage.

#### Payload Processing
Let's try adding a rule that skips any lines that start with a `.` (as shown in the wordlist screenshot earlier). We can do that by clicking on the `Add` button and then selecting `Skip if matches regex`, which allows us to provide a regex pattern for items we want to skip.

#### Payload Encoding
We'll leave it enabled.

## Options
1- `retried on failure` and `pause before retry` to 0.
2- `Grep - Match`
3- `200 OK`

## Attack

![intruder_attack](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/110/burp_intruder_attack.jpg)



we can use `Burp Intruder` to do any type of web fuzzing and brute-forcing, including brute forcing for passwords, or fuzzing for certain PHP parameters, and so on. We can even use `Intruder` to perform password spraying against applications that use Active Directory (AD) authentication such as Outlook Web Access (OWA), SSL VPN portals, Remote Desktop Services (RDS), Citrix, custom web applications that use AD authentication, and more. However, as the free version of `Intruder` is extremely throttled, in the next section, we will see ZAP's fuzzer and its various options, which do not have a paid tier.
