creates a route (`/dictionary`) that handles POST requests. It expects a `password` parameter in the request's form data. Upon receiving a request, it compares the submitted password against the expected value. If there's a match, it responds with a JSON object containing a success message and the flag. Otherwise, it returns an error message with a 401 status code (Unauthorized).
