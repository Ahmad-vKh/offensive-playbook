Possible Combinations = Character Set Size^Password Length

character set size of 26) has 26^6 (approximately 300 million) possible combinations. In contrast, an 8-character password with the same character set has 26^8 (approximately 200 billion) combinations

Supercomputer (1 trillion passwords/second): Drastically reduces cracking times for simpler passwords. However, even with this immense power, cracking highly complex passwords can take an impractical amount of time. For example, a 12-character password with all ASCII characters would still take about 15000 years to crack.
