organizations implement policies requiring users to change their passwords periodically to enhance security. However, these policies can inadvertently breed predictable password patterns

>dictionary attack, using a wordlist curated with common passwords, industry-specific terms, and potentially personal information related to the organization or its employees.

>if the dictionary attack proves unsuccessful, the hybrid attack seamlessly transitions into a brute-force mode

it strategically modifies the words from the original wordlist, appending numbers, special characters, or even incrementing years, as in our "Summer2023" example


>`It's important to note that hybrid attacks are not limited to the password change scenario described above. They can be tailored to exploit any observed or suspected password patterns within a target organization`

```
filter 8 char >
```bash
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '^.{8,}$' darkweb2017-top10000.txt > darkweb2017-minlength.txt
```
upper-case enforce:
```bash
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '[A-Z]' darkweb2017-minlength.txt > darkweb2017-uppercase.txt
```
lower-case sure:
```bash
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '[a-z]' darkweb2017-uppercase.txt > darkweb2017-lowercase.txt
```
number {0-9}:
```bash
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ grep -E '[0-9]' darkweb2017-lowercase.txt > darkweb2017-number.txt
```



It's a multi-stage process that begins with attackers acquiring lists of compromised usernames and passwords. These lists can stem from large-scale data breaches or be compiled through phishing scams and malware. Notably, publicly available wordlists like `rockyou` or those found in `seclists` can also serve as a starting point, offering attackers a trove of commonly used passwords.
