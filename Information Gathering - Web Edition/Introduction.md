1- web enumeration is one of the important start-ups to assessments


2- It forms a critical part of the "`Information Gathering`" phase of the Penetration Testing Process.


`why i do web reconnaissance ?`

`Identifying public accessible Assets`: 
web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, and technologies used.

`Discovering Hidden Information`:
including backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation
so these info can be entry point to the target network

`Analysing the Attack Surface`"
possible entry points for exploitation.
due config files , `cve's` etc..  

`Gathering Intelligence`:
Collecting information that can be leveraged for further exploitation or social engineering attacks. This includes identifying key personnel, email addresses, or patterns of behavior that could be exploited.

in the other hand <> defenders use recon to proactively identify and patch vulnerabilities before malicious actors can leverage them.


as i know there is two type of general (not specific for web) reconnaissance:
1- active
2-passive
