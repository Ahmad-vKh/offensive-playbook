as an example <> `blog.example.com` for its blog, `shop.example.com` for its online store, or `mail.example.com` for its email services.

subdomains are typically represented by `A` (or `AAAA` for IPv6) records, which map the subdomain name to its corresponding IP address. Additionally, `CNAME` records might be used to create aliases for subdomains, pointing them to other domains or subdomains.

### 1. Active Subdomain Enumeration

This involves directly interacting with the target domain's DNS servers to uncover subdomains. One method is attempting a `DNS zone transfer`, where a misconfigured server might inadvertently leak a complete list of subdomains. However, due to tightened security measures, this is rarely successful.

### 2. Passive Subdomain Enumeration
`Certificate Transparency (CT) logs`
public repositories of SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates often include a list of associated subdomains in their Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field, providing a treasure trove of potential targets.
`search engines` like Google or DuckDuckGo. By employing specialized search operators (e.g., `site:`), you can filter results to show only subdomains related to the target domain.
